Hello. My name is Tan-Si-Rui(谈思睿), call me Aaron if you prefer. I am currently a graduate student of [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu) at the department of [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.columbia.edu). 

Inspired by my undergraduate research in [biomedical signal processing](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7022704&queryText=A+Novel+Time-Frequency+Analysis+Approach+for+Nonstaionary+Time+Series+Using+Multi-resolution+Wavelet&matchBoolean=true&newsearch=true&searchField=Search_All), I am now a fan of data science. Driven by the excitement of digging hidden truth out of the flood of data, I am now learning every aspect of data sciense. I use [github](https://github.com/jangsutsr) as well as [this website](http://jangsutsr.github.io) to keep track of my progress and share ideas and experience with anyone interested. 

I love sports at leisure times. I played basketball and am now especially interested in tennis. Btw, I am the only guy among all my friends who can do [handstand push-ups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handstand_push-up) ;)

If you are interested, feel free to [e-mail](mailto:jangsutsr@gmail.com) me or choose any contact approaches below. Hope to hear from you!
