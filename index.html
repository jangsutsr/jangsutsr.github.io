<h1>Introduction to Repositories</h1>
<p>
I put all my codes, both for class assignments and for fun, on
<a href="https://github.com/jangsutsr">GitHub</a>.
They are categorized into different repositories which are listed below.

<h2>
<a href="https://github.com/jangsutsr/algorithms.git"><strong>Algorithms</strong></a>
</h2>
<p>
It contains implimentations, sometimes analysis as well, of algorithms I found worthwhile of recording.
The algorithms are grouped into different categories according to their purposes, here is a list of them:

<a href="https://github.com/jangsutsr/algorithms/tree/master/data_structures/index.html">Data Structures</a>

<h2>
<a href="https://github.com/jangsutsr/computer_networks.git"><strong>Computer Networks</strong></a>
</h2>
<p>
I am currently taking class on computer networks. This repository keeps track of my programming assignments of the course.
Note that my textbook for this class is <cite>Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach</cite>,
which means some of the ideas of my code might came from this book.
